            Bouldering can be regarded as still being relatively in its infancy in Cyprus, experiencing a boom over the past few years.

          <p class="text-content">
            For the sake of those who are not familiar with the sport, bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses. Instead, climbers use crash pads to protect themselves from falls.

            Whether you're looking for easy problems or hard projects, bouldering in Cyprus has something for everyone, with more than 700 bouldering problems ranging from f3 (V0) to f8A (V11).

            This pristine area on the western coast of Cyprus offers a wide range of bouldering spots scattered across the hills and valleys, from small lowballs to huge highball boulders, offering various styles of climbing on quality sandstone rock. There is a lot more potential for development for those feeling adventurous.

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
          <p class="text-content">
            The bouldering spots are extremely easily accessible, due to the presence of farmer roads and tracks that lead to and go around the boulders, meaning that you rarely have walking approaches longer than 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-content">
            The bouldering spots are also very close to the sea, meaning that you can easily combine your bouldering sessions with a dip in the sea.

            This area also boasts some of the best sport climbing crags on the island, with "Gerakopetra" (Hawk Rock) being the most famous one, with more in the wider Paphos region.

            Cyprus offers excellent climbing conditions throughout most of the year, with only the warmest summer months posing a challenge due to higher temperatures (even then, climbing early morning or late evening is common among the locals).
